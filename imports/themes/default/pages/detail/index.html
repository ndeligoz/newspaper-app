                        <br>
                        <p>Crowds watched solemnly as the body of Rep. John Lewis crossed the Edmund Pettus Bridge one
                            final time, 55 years after the civil rights icon marched for peace and was met with
                            brutality in Selma, Alabama.
                            <br><br>
                            Body bearers from the U.S. armed forces placed the late Georgia congressman and civil rights
                            icon onto a horse-drawn caisson Sunday at the Brown Chapel African Methodist Episcopal
                            Church. From there, the public were allowed to line up to honor Lewis for about a half-mile
                            to the foot of the bridge.
                            <br><br>
                            Rep. Terri Sewell, D-Al., thanked Lewis’ family during a ceremony at the chapel for sharing
                            the congressman with the public for so many years.
                            <br><br>
                            “Our nation is better off because of John Robert Lewis,” she remarked. “My life is better,
                            Selma is better, this nation and this world is better because of John Robert Lewis.”
                        </p>

                        <p class="pages-Detail-content__text">Solemn crowds watch as Lewis, who died earlier this month

                                17, is carried outside the Brown Chapel A.M.E. Church, in Selma, Ala., on July 26, 2020.

                        <p>Crowds waited for Lewis’ body at the foot of the bridge, where he was met by Alabama state
                            troopers, who safely escorted him across and on to the state capitol.
                            <br><br>
                            “His final march, that final crossing, so different than the first, speaks to the legacy
                            that he leaves behind and the lives that he changed,” Sewell said. "It’s poetic justice that
                            this time, Alabama state troopers will see John to his safety. "
                            <br><br>
                            As the horse-drawn caisson approached the bridge, those in the masses on the sidewalk could
                            be heard singing for Lewis. In an emotional moment, the voices stopped as Lewis' casket
                            began to make its way across the bridge in silent reverence.
                            <br><br>
                            Lewis, who died earlier this month at the age of 80, made his last journey across the Edmund
                            Pettus Bridge with only his family to join him.
                            <br><br>
                            Lewis' son, brothers and sister followed behind the caisson along Lewis' longtime chief of
                            staff wearing shirts emblazoned with the words "Good Trouble," a nod to Lewis' view on
                            activism.

                        <p>The 16-term lawmaker, often called the conscience of Congress, was a giant of the civil
                            rights movement of the 1960s. Lewis was only 25 when he believed Alabama troopers would kill
                            him on the peaceful march for voting rights across the bridge on March 7, 1965, known today
                            as “Bloody Sunday.”
                            <br><br>
                            Lewis suffered a fractured skull and was one of dozens of nonviolent protesters who were
                            hospitalized. News coverage of the brutal beatings prompted increased pressure on Congress
                            to pass the 1965 Voting Rights Act, to bar states from enforcing discriminatory laws that
                            had long hindered prospective Black voters.
                            <br><br>
                            And though Lewis is possibly best known for his march in Selma, he had already emerged as a
                            leading voice in the fight for equal rights and had been arrested a number of times for the
                            cause by that time.
